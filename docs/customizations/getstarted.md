# Get Started With Customizations

Welcome to this development guide on Chat Widget customizations. You just started you first step to make your chat widget more aligned with your business needs and themes.

**IMPORTANT!!!**
**If you are using the Omnichannel out-of-box chat widget (script offering), please read [this document](www.html) first before you're go through this dev guide. Although the script offering uptakes the `<LiveChatWidget/>` React component and shares the same interfaces, it does offer less customizabilities then the React component. In addition, some implementation details might differ as well.**
